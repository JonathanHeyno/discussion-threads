# Discussion Threads Application

An application for maintaining discussion threads on various topics

The application has a collection of discussion topics created by administrators under which users can start new related conversations or participate in an existing one when logged in.

On the main page users can see a listing of all the topics, and for each topic the number of threads, total amount of messages, and the time of the latest message to see if there has recently been any activity on the forum.

After creating an account, a user can create a new thread under a topic by entering a title for the thread and contents via an initial message. The user can also add a message to an existing thread. The user can also modify the title and message he has sent, as well as delete them. A user may also delete the entire thread he has created. The application also has a keyword search functionality by which the user can find all messages containing the given search word.

Administrators can add and remove topics. They can also create hidden topics and determine which users have access to them.
